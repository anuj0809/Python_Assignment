      "BTS is known to keep their private lives closely guarded. BTS leader RM aka Kim Namjoon has said that when he thinks of love, he does not only think of romantic love but likes to see it in a more all-encompassing manner. He is soon coming on the show, The Mysterious Dictionary Of Useless Human Knowledge. He is one of the anchors for the show that comes on MC TVN channel in South Korea. Kim Namjoon aka BTS RM is seen having a chat where he says that when he thinks of love he thinks of the huge umbrella of emotions that also include dislike and jealousy Another person tells him that once two people get too familiar in love, all the sensations like butterflies in the stomach go missing. BTS RM aka Kim Namjoon looks disappointed, and says it is so sad. On seeing the clip, BTS ARMY has taken to Twitter to explain it to him that is not like that. Others are discussing that he is such an eternal romantic and a hopeless one at that. Take a look at the tweets Years back, he did say that he had a girlfriend when he was in school. But the affair was rather short-lived. He said that she had a lot of guy friends, and some of her actions were 'unacceptable' to him given his situation and circumstances at that time of life. He said they had too many arguments, and felt it was better to end things on a good note. BTS RM aka Kim Namjoon is labelled as the most wanted Asian son-in-law type by fans\n"
